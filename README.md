# makeithappen

Make it happen is an application design competition being piloted across 4 primary schools in the Glasgow area.

## Why?

As part of J.P.Morgans School Outreach programme we intend to enable pupils to think, design and (if they win) build an application with the help of our expert engineers.

Our goal is to reach all pupils from P1-P7 and let them start their digital design thinking.

## Who?

We are targetting 4 pilot primary schools to allow us to quickly trial the concept and make it happen.

We will include all pupils from P1-P7 in the pilot schools.

Pilot Schools:
- Saint Josephs, Clarkston
- Saint Michaels, Parkhead
- Burnside Primary, Rutherglen
- Saint John the Baptist, Uddingston


## What?

You can see here the teacher guide and pupil competition entry form.

Pupils are encouraged to be as creative as possible with their ideas!
